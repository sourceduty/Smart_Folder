> Programmable file folder that automatically organizes the files inside of it.

#
### Programmed Directory and Tasks

This component involves a smart directory system that automatically organizes files according to predefined criteria such as file type, modification date, and creator. The system should include scripts or small applications that monitor folder activity and reorganize files as needed. Additionally, automation for naming and metatagging should be implemented, allowing files to be automatically renamed and tagged based on established rules. This automation can leverage file properties or metadata extraction tools to effectively categorize and organize files, making retrieval and management more efficient.

#
### Change Log and File Versioning

To maintain a comprehensive record of file modifications and ensure data integrity, integrating a change log and version control system is essential. A logging system can be set up to capture every alteration made to the files within the directory. This can be achieved using file system watchers that trigger logs upon any file modifications. Moreover, a version control system can be developed or integrated, similar to Git but tailored for non-code files, to manage file versions and provide the capability to revert to previous states when necessary.

#
### Automatic Folder Task Program File

At the heart of the directory system is the automatic folder task program, a core engine that continuously manages and organizes folder contents. This could be realized through a daemon or background service that runs persistently, processing any new additions or changes according to predefined rules. This automation ensures that the system is self-sustaining and operates without manual intervention, continuously keeping the directory organized and up-to-date.

#
### Drop Folder

The drop folder serves as a primary entry point where users can add files. Upon addition, these files trigger the automatic organization and logging mechanisms of the system. Setting up a designated drop folder and implementing file handling automation scripts can streamline the workflow. These scripts would automatically move files to their appropriate destinations, apply naming and tagging conventions, and update logs and metadata, thereby simplifying the process of file management and ensuring systematic organization.

#
### Smart Folder C++

The provided code implements a "Smart Folder" in C++ for a Windows environment. This program monitors a specific directory for new files and automatically organizes these files into subdirectories based on their extensions. It uses the Windows API to detect changes in the directory and the C++ Standard Library's filesystem utilities to manage files and directories.

To integrate the "Smart Folder" functionality into Windows, you can create a Windows service that continuously monitors a specified directory and organizes files based on their extensions. This approach ensures that the smart folder functionality runs in the background without user intervention and starts automatically with the system.
